# Habit App
*Project stage as at 4 Sep 2023: Initial Research*

## Aim
Create a mobile app for tracking and managing habit formation.

## Basic idea
* User inputs their end goal for the habit (e.g. go to the gym 5 days a week)
* App develops timeline to work up to that goal with reasonable progression
* Provides user with notifications of time to do the action
* For missed goals, user needs to provide an excuse
* App analyses excuse for common themes and suggests changes to routine

## Tasks
- [ ] Research habit formation
- [ ] Determine initial project roadmap

## Notes
### Miscellaneous Thoughts
* 2 potential forms of use, one being the formation of new habits and the other being the kicking of bad habits. These could require different approaches.

### Research
